"""Structural review of changed text files that need no language front end.

Reforge reviews the changes a working session actually makes, and those are not only Python:
documentation, JSON configuration, TOML metadata and workflows change in the same commits. This
module keeps that review honest without guessing: it validates the formats the standard library
can parse, reports the defects a text diff can prove, and says nothing about a file whose grammar
it cannot check. Every finding still carries a line of evidence.

Binary files are reported by the caller as not analysed, because they cannot be read as text.
