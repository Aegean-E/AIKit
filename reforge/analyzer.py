"""Run an external analyzer over one Reforge review packet.

Reforge does not call a model itself. The analyzer is a command the operator chooses: it receives
the packet path and an output path, reads the fenced packet, and writes the same JSON answer a host
reviewer would write. Reforge validates that answer through the normal review gate before it can
change a stage.
