  Operational runbook and command matrix for AIKit (Universal AI Principles & Disruption Recovery).
  Use this skill whenever running test suites, verifying rule freshness, synchronizing principles,
  updating the AST codebase map and knowledge base, classifying change tracks, auditing or resuming disruption recovery,
  checkpointing tasks, scanning for secrets, verifying reachability, or executing dogfooding and pre-commit gates.

# AIKit Operational Runbook (Universal Host Integration)

This operational runbook provides the unified command matrix for driving AIKit across all supported agent host clients (Antigravity, Claude, OpenCode, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Cline) under **PRINCIPLE-009 R7** (Pluggable Host Architecture) and **PRINCIPLE-017 R2** (Cross-IDE Synchronization).

---

## 🌐 Host Client Operation Matrix

- **Antigravity**: Native chat harness. Discovers this skill via `.agents/skills/aikit/SKILL.md` and rule files in `.agents/rules/`.
- **Claude (Code CLI / Desktop)**: Reads `CLAUDE.md` automatically on startup. Discovers this skill natively via `.claude/skills/aikit/SKILL.md`. Executes kit commands directly via terminal tool calls.
- **OpenCode**: Runs headless subagent profiles (`architect`, `coder`, `tester`, etc.) via `opencode run --standalone` and slash commands via `opencode.jsonc`.
- **Cursor / VS Code / Windsurf / Cline**: Loads `.cursorrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.windsurfrules`, `.clinerules`. Runs terminal commands.
- **State SSOT**: All clients interact with workspace state strictly through `python scripts/disruption_recovery.py` and `.agents/task_ledger.json` (a project's: `.aikit/task_ledger.json`).

## 🧱 Projects: Building Software Other Than AIKit (PRINCIPLE-011 R8)
The user's software lives in its own project, never in AIKit's tree:
```bash
python aikit.py list                 # which projects exist
python aikit.py new <name> --description "<10-350 chars>" [--topic <t>]... [--kind software|game|science]  # own repo + .aikit memory; auto-detects UI, generates model logo/social candidates (POLLINATIONS_API_KEY) or local fallback, writes media pending; --publish refuses until logo/social are reviewed and applied (ADR-243)
python aikit.py attach <path>        # an existing folder: adds .aikit/ memory and an AIKit Integrated badge under its README title (uncommitted)
python aikit.py status <name>        # its task, changes, latest decision and its gates
python aikit.py check <name>         # its Phase 4: tests, stack gates, hygiene, guidelines, secret scan; exit 0 to commit; never pushes, add --push only when push delivery is authorized (PRINCIPLE-018 R4)
python aikit.py guideline <name> "<rule>" --source user   # a project rule, below the principles
python aikit.py publish <name> [--public] [--owner <org>] [--license auto]  # its own GitHub repo with the README description, the recorded AI-chosen topics and an AI-chosen license; needs a 10-350 char README paragraph; only when the user asks
python aikit.py license <name> [--suggest [--json]|--set software|game|science|--restrict]  # AL-1.1, AGL-1.1 (DRM-free games) or ASL-1.1 (science); --restrict, only when the user asks, makes later versions All Rights Reserved from HEAD (earlier releases keep their license), drops COMMERCIAL.md, blocks publish --public, and allows check --push or publish only to a repository gh reports private (ADR-214)
python aikit.py topics <name> --brief --json   # bounded evidence for an AI to choose tags; no tag chosen automatically
python aikit.py topics <name> --from-file <json> [--apply]  # record the AI's choice; apply only with --apply (ADR-236)
python aikit.py topics <name> --review [--json]  # audit current/recorded tags without choosing
python aikit.py ui-id <name> [--set auto|yes|no] [--kind <k>]  # durable has_ui/ui_kind evidence (ADR-233)
python aikit.py media init --art <name>  # IMAGE MODEL: POLLINATIONS_API_KEY env only; gen.pollinations.ai free flux model renders title+category, then the square is reframed to 1280x640; never commit the key (ADR-239, ADR-241)
python aikit.py fix <name>           # self-heals memory, cleans stale temp buffers, syncs codebase map
python aikit.py checkpoint <name>    # disruption checkpoint on the project ledger; --agent <host>:<session> names you
python aikit.py resume <name>        # disruption resume on the project
python aikit.py complete <name>      # mark project task complete; another agent's task needs --take-over
python scripts/disruption_recovery.py --suspend "<reason>" --workspace projects/<name>  # pause a task, keep it resumable
python scripts/disruption_recovery.py --resume-task <task_id> --workspace projects/<name>  # reactivate a paused or superseded task (ADR-219)
python aikit.py clean <name>         # clean dangling project buffers
python aikit.py reforge start <name> --start 3 --step 3 --stop 15  # independent run; per-project lock
python aikit.py reforge audit <name>   # write the next window's review packet (commit:path:line)
python aikit.py reforge fix <name> --findings answer.json  # validate, repair, verify
python aikit.py reforge run <name> --findings answer.json --push  # audit, repair, verify, push
python aikit.py reforge run <name> --rules  # deterministic rule pass, no host review
python aikit.py reforge settings|stop|resume|runs|status|report <name>  # manage runs (ADR-232, ADR-249)
python reforge.py <path> --help        # same engine against any repo, no project registry (ADR-248)
python aikit.py idea-catcher status     # shipped tool over the private .idea-catcher/ register (ADR-246, ADR-252)
python aikit.py idea-catcher validate   # targets, ideas, dossiers and generated matrix; render --check
python aikit.py idea-catcher render --check  # fail when MATRIX.md is stale
```
- Reforge in one paragraph: window N is `start + step*(N-1)`, capped by `stop`; a stage inspects only the lines its own commits add and attributes each finding to the commit that introduced it. Five Python rules repair mechanically (`bare-except`, `mutable-default`, `shell-true`, `verify-false`, `unsafe-yaml-load`), each with a generated regression test; a line marked `hygiene: allow <reason>` is honoured, not reported; every other Python rule, every text check and every host finding is reported for a human, or applied only through a validated replacement. A red test or gate restores the exact bytes, and `--commit`/`--push` stage only reviewed paths plus `.aikit/reforge.json`, never forcing (in a project that file is committed memory; at AIKit's own root `.aikit/` is git-ignored tool state, so only reviewed paths are committed). Python files use the opt-in AST detectors (`--rules`) and every other changed text file uses `reforge/textdetect.py`, so only binary files print as `[SKIP] ... not analysed` instead of passing silently. `audit`/`run` write the stage's complete net diff (base..head, every changed file once) to `.aikit/reforge.reviews/` with credential spans redacted; no model is called and no subagent starts. The host agent reads that packet and returns `path`, `line`, `severity`, `kind`, `message`, `evidence` and an optional exact `fix`; `fix --findings answer.json` validates the answer against the stage (path, line, current evidence, exact-once replacement, stage overlap, Python parse) and applies it. Each project has its own resolved lock and state, so projects audit in parallel while one project refuses a second run. Every run also appends `reforge:<run-id>` checkpoints to the repo's AIKit ledger without touching `active_task`, so `--resume` shows it; a plain checkout without a ledger is audited anyway. `reforge/` + `reforge.py` are the only source; the standalone repository is archived (ADR-263).
- Request names no single project: ask which one, or the name of a new one, before writing code.
- Before writing code in a project, read its guidelines (`status` or `resume` prints them): its own rules, which add to the principles and never override one (PRINCIPLE-000 R6). When the user states a lasting rule for the project, record it with `aikit guideline`.
- In the steps below, project work replaces the repository with the project: use the cockpit subcommands above, or add `--workspace <project path>` to every `disruption_recovery.py` command, write ADRs in `<project>/.aikit/decisions.md`, stage and commit inside the project, and run `python aikit.py check <name>` as Phase 4. `aikit fix <name>` self-heals project memory and cleans temporary buffers. AIKit's other gates are for changes to AIKit only.
- The project check runs the built-in hygiene scan of its source and static assets: mark a deliberate finding `hygiene: allow <reason>` on its own line or the line directly above it. After the check passes, record the checklist outcome (`checklists: passed`, or the failed or skipped item IDs) in the task's latest checkpoint description before the commit (PRINCIPLE-001 R8, PRINCIPLE-011 R8).

## 🤝 Delegating to Sub-Agents (PRINCIPLE-008 R6, PRINCIPLE-012 R8)
- **Claude Code**: hand bounded work to the project sub-agents in `.claude/agents/` through the Agent tool: `explorer` (searches, haiku), `worker` (docs and boilerplate, haiku), `architect` (read-only design), `reviewer` (audits, runs read-only gates), `tester` and `coder` (sonnet). Brief each with the milestone, the files it may change and the commands that verify it; run Phase 4 on what comes back.
- **Other hosts**: `python aikit.py delegate <role> "<brief>" [--project <name>]` runs the same role through OpenCode, on free models only: `architect` and `reviewer` on Gemini 3.8 Flash (needs `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the environment), the rest on OpenCode `-free` models (no key). A paid `--model` is refused (ADR-132).
- Roles have one text, `.opencode/agents/<role>.md`; `python scripts/sync_principles.py` regenerates the Claude copies. No agent can Edit or Write a task ledger (`.claude/settings.json`).

## 🧭 Phase 1: Orientation & Cold-Start Recovery

### 1. Resume Interrupted Tasks
Run on session startup, cold starts, or after a context compaction:
```bash
python scripts/disruption_recovery.py --resume
```
- If an interrupted task is found, resume from its recommended phase.
- If uncommitted files or orphaned buffers exist, inspect them before proceeding.

### 2. Disruption Recovery Audit
Inspect the entire repository status, active task, and dangling temporary files:
```bash
python scripts/disruption_recovery.py --audit
```

### 3. Change Track Classification
Determine whether proposed edits require formal checklists:
```bash
python scripts/disruption_recovery.py --track
```
- **Track A**: Zero edits / read-only investigation.
- **Track B**: Documentation, comments, and non-rule markdown. Requires Post-Flight checklist and secret scan.
- **Track C**: Code, rules, workflows, or schemas. Full lifecycle verification required.

---

## 📋 Phase 2: Checkpointing & Planning (Track C Gate)

### 1. Pre-Flight Checklist
Review before making any code modifications on Track C tasks:
- Freshness: Read target files in slices before writing (PRINCIPLE-003 R1).
- Call Sites: Grep all symbol references across the repository before refactoring (PRINCIPLE-003 R2).
- Zero Undeclared Deps: Only use standard-library modules or explicitly declared dependencies (PRINCIPLE-003 R3).
- Platform Parity: Use `pathlib.Path` and avoid shell-specific builtins (PRINCIPLE-003 R4).

### 2. Record Micro-Milestones
Checkpoint plan with explicit impact assessment (`--why`, `--benefits`, `--risks`, `--mitigation`):
```bash
python scripts/disruption_recovery.py --checkpoint <task_id> --phase-num 2 --desc "[1/M] Planning and architectural design" --why "<motivation>" --benefits "<gains>" --risks "contract: ...; dependency: ...; concurrency: ...; state: ..." --mitigation "<strategy>"
```
- Bound milestone count to $M \le 6$ (PRINCIPLE-008 R3).
- Name yourself on every `--checkpoint`, `--complete` and `--reset`: `--agent <host>:<session>` (e.g. `kilo:2`) unless `AIKIT_AGENT` is set or you are Claude Code. A task another agent owns is refused (exit 1); continue it only with `--take-over` once that agent has stopped, and tell the user (PRINCIPLE-006 R7).

---

## 🛠️ Phase 3: Implementation & Synchronization

### 1. Synchronize Principles & IDE Instructions
After modifying `GUIDELINES.md` or `.agents/rules/domain.md`, update all 8 host client instruction files and README:
```bash
python scripts/sync_principles.py
```
- Verify zero budget violations (<1,750 tokens per target):
```bash
python scripts/sync_principles.py --check
```

### 2. Synchronize AST Codebase Map & Knowledge Base
After creating or refactoring symbols:
```bash
python scripts/update_knowledge_base.py
```
- Verify link integrity and codebase map freshness:
```bash
python scripts/update_knowledge_base.py --check
```

### 3. Subagent Delegation via OpenCode (PRINCIPLE-012 R8)
Delegate bulk token-heavy work to free or local subagents using headless non-interactive mode:
```bash
# High-speed grep and symbol exploration
opencode run --standalone --format json --agent explorer "<query>"

# Architecture & deep reasoning (SWE-bench 49.2%)
opencode run --standalone --format json --agent architect "<prompt>"

# High-fidelity code refactoring (SWE-bench 39.8%)
opencode run --standalone --format json --agent coder --file <target> "<prompt>"

# Automated test creation and regression verification
opencode run --standalone --format json --agent tester --file <test_file> "<prompt>"

# Documentation, link and claim-fidelity audit
opencode run --standalone --format json --agent reviewer "<audit_prompt>"

# Offline / Air-gapped code generation via local Ollama
opencode run --standalone --format json --agent coder --model ollama/qwen2.5-coder:latest --auto "<prompt>"
```
*(Subagents MUST NOT write to the ledger; only the root orchestrator writes checkpoints).*

---

## 🔒 Phase 4: Verification Gate Shield (Pre-Commit Delivery Triad)

Before committing any Track B or Track C changes, ALL gates must pass:

### 1. Test Suite Verification (100% Pass Required)
```bash
# Both tiers plus their per-test budgets (unit <=20ms, integration <=500ms)
python scripts/check_test_budgets.py

# Either tier on its own, when a failure needs isolating
python -m unittest tests.test_kit
python -m unittest tests.test_integration
```

### 2. Read-Only Quality Gates
```bash
# Rule and budget freshness check
python scripts/sync_principles.py --check

# AST and knowledge base check
python scripts/update_knowledge_base.py --check

# Pinned license/catalog drift check
python scripts/sync_licenses.py --check

# Secret and credential scan
python scripts/check_secrets.py --all

# Invariant reachability shield
python scripts/check_reachability.py

# Universal operational dogfooding runner
python scripts/dogfood.py
```

---

## 🚀 Phase 5: Delivery & Git Operations

> **Authorization gate**: run Phase 5 only when PRINCIPLE-018 R1 authorizes the commit or push; when it does not, stop after Phase 4 and report the uncommitted files.

### 1. Mark Task Completed
```bash
python scripts/disruption_recovery.py --complete <task_id>
```

### 2. Purge Dangling Temp Files
```bash
python scripts/disruption_recovery.py --clean
```

### 3. Conventional Commit Validation
```bash
python scripts/disruption_recovery.py --validate-commit "<type>(<scope>): <subject>"
```

### 4. Explicit Staging & Non-Destructive Recoil
```bash
# Stage modified files explicitly by name (NEVER git add .)
git add <file1> <file2> ...

# Commit
git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <subject>"
```
