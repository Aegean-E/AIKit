# System Architecture & Component Boundaries

This document describes how AIKit is built. The rules it follows live only in `GUIDELINES.md`; this file names the principle a mechanism serves and never restates its rules (PRINCIPLE-001 R7). Numbers below cite the code constant that holds them, so the value has one home.

## 🏛️ Components & Data Flow
AIKit is standard-library CLIs in `scripts/` plus the project CLI `aikit.py` and the files they read and write. No gate CLI imports another (PRINCIPLE-009 R5); `services.md` lists each one's responsibility and gate.

```text
GUIDELINES.md ──sync_principles.py──▶ AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, .cursorrules,
  (only hand-edited rules)              .github/copilot-instructions.md, .agents/rules/principles.md,
.agents/rules/domain.md (Tier 1B) ──▶   README.md principle table (between markers)

repository *.py ──update_knowledge_base.py──▶ knowledge/codebase_map.md
                  └─ audits: README, ADR register, unfinished code, code structure

agent ──disruption_recovery.py──▶ .agents/task_ledger.json (AIKit's only state file)

user ──aikit.py──▶ projects/<name>/ (own git repo) with .aikit/project.json; projects/attached.json

Phase 4 gates: both test tiers, sync_principles.py --check, update_knowledge_base.py --check,
               check_reachability.py, check_secrets.py, dogfood.py   (PRINCIPLE-018 R3)
```

`scripts/proof_gate.py --base <commit> --tests <path> [--sources <path> --mutants N]` proves a
declared test failed on the base tree and passes now, then scores bounded single-line mutants;
these are both halves of IDEA-956 (ADR-288, ADR-289). A commit that carries `.aikit/proof.json`
also runs that proof from `verify_commit.py` against its parent (ADR-291). Mutation sources are
resolved against the repository and must stay inside it; the scoring copy skips VCS internals,
project/reference checkouts, dependency folders and generated caches (ADR-296).

Each post-commit gate carries its own bound: the tiers gate gets room for all three tiers plus the
retry allowance, and every single-script gate keeps `GATE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`. A tier that overruns the
`check_test_budgets.py` hang detector is reported as `[FAIL] <tier>: did not finish within Ns` with
its own Why/Fix and exit 1, never as a raised `TimeoutExpired` (ADR-293).

## 🧭 Projects: AIKit as the Workspace
AIKit is the folder a person opens in an AI host; the software it builds lives in `projects/<name>/`, each its own git repository with its memory in `.aikit/`. See [ADR-119](decisions.md).

- **Isolation**: `projects/` is in `.gitignore`, in `IGNORE_DIRS` (codebase map, structure audits) and in `SWEEP_PRUNED_DIRS` (temp-file and quarantine sweeps), so no project file reaches AIKit's gates, map or ledger, and `--track` never sees one. The sweep also prunes `references/`, `scratch/`, dependency folders and generated caches, so an audit costs a walk of AIKit rather than of every checkout kept beside it (ADR-295).
- **Discovery**: a folder under `projects/` is a project when it holds `.aikit/project.json`; only folders elsewhere are listed in `projects/attached.json`. `attach` refuses a folder that contains or sits inside AIKit outside `projects/`.
- **Project guidelines**: `.aikit/guidelines.md` holds the project's own rules (PRINCIPLE-001 R4 project tier). They cannot enter Tier 1, which every project shares, so `aikit status` and `aikit resume`, the project cold start, print them with their rank; `guideline_errors` keeps them well-formed and unable to override a principle (ADR-129).
- **Self-check**: the built-in `guidelines` gate runs `update_knowledge_base.py --workspace <project> --check`, whose `check_workspace` is the same code path as AIKit's own `--check`: map freshness (once `fix` wrote a map), the full PRINCIPLE-005 README audit, unfinished code, code structure and the ADR register (ADR-124, ADR-128).
- **Detection**: `DETECTORS` maps marker files to a stack and its test command; a new stack is one row.
- **Gates**: `project_gates.resolve_gates` orders a project's gates as test, extras from `EXTRA_GATES` (only what the project's own config declares: ruff/mypy tables, `lint`/`typecheck`/`build` package scripts, `go vet`), a declared `mechanics.test`, `project.json` `gates` overrides, then the built-in hygiene scan, the guidelines check and the secret scan (ADR-137, ADR-271). `run_shell` runs each through the platform shell under `supervised()` with stdin closed and `GATE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`; every gate runs even after a failure (ADR-122).
- **Memory**: `.aikit/` holds `project.json`, `decisions.md` and `task_ledger.json`. Every ledger command takes `--workspace <project>`, so checkpoints, `--resume`, `--audit` and `--track` read the project's ledger and run `git status` in the project's repository; the project ledger is bookkeeping (`BOOKKEEPING_PATHS`), so a checkpoint never changes the project's track. Project work runs `python aikit.py check <name>` as its Phase 4 (ADR-123); AIKit's other gates cover AIKit only (PRINCIPLE-011 R8, ADR-121). `new` commits the memory as the first commit, and raises with the remediation triad, removing the half-made folder, instead of inventing an author when git has no identity (ADR-120, ADR-171).
- **Delivery**: `check --strict` adds the commit-level baseline: a git repository, no uncommitted non-bookkeeping changes, no unresolved merge conflicts, no open UI task, and `.aikit/codebase_map.md` when Python sources exist. Ordinary `check` warns about those gaps, prints `[DELIVERY] NOT READY` while the tree is dirty or conflicted, and skips auto-push, so an older commit is never presented as the tested one (ADR-142, ADR-153, ADR-155). `status --exit-code` exposes the same dirty/unauditable signal for scripts, while `check_project_hygiene.py --artifacts` decides root test modules (including ignored ones and unittest's `test*.py` names), untracked root source/output and tracked caches from git's own file lists (ADR-153, ADR-156). The opt-in `ui` commands bound edits to one committed `.aikit/ui.json` surface from a clean baseline, refusing protected or out-of-surface paths, diff-budget overruns, a moved baseline and a red fast proof; abort restores only the surface with a backup (ADR-158). `verify` also diffs a project-declared snapshot inventory against its baseline, flags hardcoded color and font literals outside declared theme paths, and `finish` requires a recorded human review and appends the task's evidence to `.aikit/ui_history.json` (ADR-160, ADR-161). `fix` adopts a detected UI project when it has a test command: it writes a conservative contract and sets `ui_required` rather than inventing a proof; a declared `mechanics` contract is validated and run as a gate so an agent and the UI use the same headless core (ADR-271).

## 🔁 Aegean Reforge: Integrated History Reviewer
`reforge/` is an AIKit subsystem, not a separately synchronized repository: cloning AIKit yields
the only copy of the working source. `aikit.py reforge` reaches it through AIKit's registry, gates,
secret scanner and atomic persistence; `reforge.py` and `python -m reforge` are the same engine
without the project registry. The layers run one direction: `cli` -> `pipeline` ->
`audit`/`review`/`repair`/`verification`/`state`/`delivery` -> `model`.
Each project has independent runs stored together with a per-project run lock: several projects
audit concurrently, while a second operation on one project is refused. A target is resolved before
the lock is taken, so two spellings of one checkout cannot create two locks. A run's window is
`start + step*(N-1)`, capped by `stop`; independent runs can audit the same history with different
settings, and a stopped or completed run keeps its history when another begins. Within a run, every
previously audited SHA stays in view for interaction evidence; a mechanical repair is applied by rule,
a reviewed patch only after it was validated against the lines the stage added, one regression test is
generated per repaired rule/file, the real diff is reviewed, the project's tests run, and a red
result rolls the patch back. Reforge repairs beside unrelated uncommitted work: those paths are
snapshotted, allowed in the diff review and never staged, while a commit is refused if a finding's
own target already held work Reforge did not make (`--allow-dirty` overrides that refusal).
Reforge plans, records and delivers the stage; the host agent does the
reviewing, in any language and for both defects and improvements. The cheap rule pass is on by
default (`--no-rules` skips it); Python files go through the AST detectors and other text files
through `reforge/textdetect.py`. Either way the stage reports only genuinely binary paths as not
analysed and prints how many files it reviewed; a finding whose line carries the project's
`hygiene: allow <reason>` marker is dropped. The five fixable rules are `bare-except`,
`mutable-default`, `shell-true`, `verify-false` and `unsafe-yaml-load`.
`reforge/review.py` writes every new commit's own hunks, oldest to newest, with a stable hunk id,
to `.aikit/reforge.reviews/`, redacted with the project's secret scanner. The repository-derived
text is wrapped in a random-id `<untrusted_repo_data_...>` fence and the prompt names it untrusted
data, never instructions; a commit cannot close the fence because the id is generated per packet
(ADR-287). The same module reads the reviewer's JSON answer: every path and line must belong to the stage, quoted evidence must exist in the current
file, and a suggested replacement must occur exactly once, overlap a line a new commit added, and parse,
after which `repair.apply_text_patches` applies it and the same tests, gates and diff review decide
whether it survives. A finding may name its `commit` and `hunk`. Every packet hunk must be attested
in `reviewed_hunks` by an object with the hunk id, a verbatim quote of a line that hunk adds (or
removes, for a deletion-only hunk) and a note no other entry repeats (ADR-292); an id-only list, a
quote from another hunk or a duplicated note is stored as a partial review and blocks progress. The
answer file is capped at 4 MiB, and the review records whether the host or an analyzer produced it. Every retained
stage must be reviewed before the next stage or run completion; `review --stage N --findings` records
the host review of an older stage, while `fix --findings` reviews the latest one (ADR-272, ADR-273).
`analyze` runs an operator-supplied analyzer command on a stage packet: the command receives the
packet path and an answer path, and its JSON answer goes through the same validation and review gate.
The analyzer is where a model or a static tool is plugged in; Reforge itself starts no model
(ADR-290).
The main host model is the default reviewer; subagents and external analyzers are opt-in for
explicitly delegated or specialized work. Reforge itself makes no model call, API key or subagent
invocation in the loop; `audit` writes
the packet, `fix --findings` applies the answer, and `run --findings` does both. A separate `fix`
refreshes the history entry `report` reads, a second `fix --commit` delivers an already-reviewed
patch, and raising `--stop` reopens a completed run.
Run lifecycle events are mirrored into the repository's AIKit task ledger by `reforge/ledger.py`
under a `reforge:<run-id>` task: entries are appended under the ledger lock with `active_task`
untouched, a stopped run is `suspended` (so `--resume` lists it as resumable), a run reaching its
stop is `completed`, and the ledger's `.bak`/`.lock` siblings are treated as Reforge's own
bookkeeping by the clean-tree and patch-review checks. The ledger is found by name, so AIKit's
`.agents/task_ledger.json` still records a run after Reforge creates its own `.aikit/` state folder.
A repository without a ledger is audited unchanged and the CLI says nothing was recorded. See
[ADR-230](decisions.md), [ADR-232](decisions.md), [ADR-248](decisions.md),
[ADR-249](decisions.md), [ADR-250](decisions.md) and [ADR-263](decisions.md).

## 🧭 Idea Catcher: Shipped Register Tool
`idea_catcher/` is the tool AIKit ships for its private idea register: cloning AIKit yields the
full source, while the data (`targets.json`, `ideas.json`, `reviews.json`, `dossiers/`) lives in
the git-ignored `.idea-catcher/` folder at the AIKit root and never enters Git. `aikit.py
idea-catcher` reaches the same `idea_catcher.registry.run` dispatcher as `idea_catcher.py` and
`python -m idea_catcher`; the default register root is `.idea-catcher/`, overridable with
`IDEA_CATCHER_ROOT`. There is no second copy or sync marker any more: the archived standalone
repository pointed here instead (ADR-246, ADR-252). A commit message that names `IDEA-NNN` is
the implementation signal: `aikit check --push` and `aikit publish` register matching ideas as
`Integrated` after a successful delivery and refresh `MATRIX.md`; `idea-catcher sync` exposes the
same scan on demand (ADR-275). `ideas` hides
`Rejected` rows, rows
tagged `duplicate` and `Blocked` rows unless `--include-rejected` / `--include-duplicates` /
`--include-blocked` or an explicit `--status Rejected` / `--tag duplicate` / `--status Blocked`
asks for them; the include flags are alternatives, so either one shows a row that belongs to
several categories. `review-idea` records a second-pass verdict with its evidence. A second
`defer` verdict moves the idea to `Blocked`, which refuses every later review and status change;
the block is terminal (ADR-286). `MATRIX.md` keeps the full audit record, and `status` counts the
full register while `ideas` remains the filtered working list (ADR-264, ADR-267).

## 🖼️ UI Identity, AI Topic Briefs and Reviewed Media
`scripts/project_ui.py` writes `has_ui`/`ui_kind`/`ui_evidence` into each project's
`.aikit/project.json`; screenshots are refused when the identifier is false (ADR-233).
`scripts/project_topics.py` emits a bounded brief and validates an AI-chosen list; it never adds a
tag automatically, and `publish` applies only the recorded choice (ADR-236).
`scripts/project_media.py` generates logo/social candidates, captures a UI at a named commit,
requires an agent/subagent/human review with notes, and applies only approved assets to the project
README and `projects/AegeanWorks/docs/media/<Repo>.json` (ADR-235). `project_artwork.py` calls the online Pollinations image model with a secret environment key and
asks it for the final logo and social card: exact title plus category, with no tagline or chips
(ADR-239, ADR-241). The local SVG lockup remains a no-key fallback. Every logo and social card is
reviewed individually by a vision subagent before approval (ADR-240). The README shows exactly one
social preview, no logo hero, the commit/date caption under screenshots, and the generated-asset
disclaimer; an older project banner is preferred and moved into `assets/` unless the user chooses
the new render (ADR-242). AegeanWorks keeps its own curated badge block, so the generated license
and AIKit row is skipped there (ADR-247). `new` runs this pipeline automatically and both publish paths refuse
unreviewed logo/social assets, so a project cannot skip the review step (ADR-243). Reforge has no
separate standalone copy any more: AIKit's root is its only source and the former repository is
archived (ADR-248).

## 🤝 Sub-Agent Roles Across Hosts
Each role (`architect`, `coder`, `explorer`, `reviewer`, `tester`, `worker`) has one text, `.opencode/agents/<role>.md`. OpenCode runs it directly (`aikit delegate`); `sync_principles.py` renders it into `.claude/agents/<role>.md` with the tools and model from `CLAUDE_AGENT_ROLES`, and `--check` reports a drifted copy. `render_claude_agent` refuses a description that would break YAML frontmatter. See [ADR-131](decisions.md).

## 🗂️ Single Source of Truth & Generated Tier 1 Files
The rules live in exactly one hand-edited file. See [ADR-048](decisions.md).

| File | Tier | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `GUIDELINES.md` | 2 | The only hand-edited copy: Problem, Concept, Invariant, Rules, checklists |
| `AGENTS.md` | 1 | **Generated** capsules; auto-loaded by AGENTS.md-convention agents |
| `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.agents/rules/principles.md` | 1 | Generated capsules for each IDE |

- **Why AGENTS.md cannot be the specification**: tools following the AGENTS.md convention load it automatically, so whatever it holds is Tier 1; as the master spec it put ~13 times the budget into always-on context.
- **Write safety**: `is_generated_target()` recognises current and legacy generated headers; anything else is refused with `[PROTECTED]` before any target is written, protecting an adopter's own `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Schema gate**: `parse_principles()` rejects a principle without Problem, Concept, Invariant or Rules, a rule without an audience tag, a duplicate ID or a phase inversion (PRINCIPLE-017 R1, R5).
- **Cross-principle gate**: `--check` compares `GUIDELINES.md` and `decisions.md` with `HEAD`; every principle whose section changed needs a new ADR naming its `--citing` set (PRINCIPLE-000 R3, ADR-073).

## 📏 Tier 1 Context Budget
Always-injected rules cost context on every turn, so the budget is a gate. See [ADR-046](decisions.md).

| Ceiling | Constant | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|
| Total per target, Tier 1B included | `TARGET_TOKEN_BUDGET` | `[TOKEN EXCEEDED]` blocks sync |
| Tier 1B reservation | `MAX_DOMAIN_CHARS` must still fit with no domain rules loaded | `[TIER 1B HEADROOM]` blocks sync |
| Early warning | 90% of budget | `[BUDGET WARN]`, advisory |

Budget is reclaimed by deleting duplication, never by compressing mechanisms out of a capsule (PRINCIPLE-001 R2); `TestTier1ContextBudget` pins the mechanism words capsules must keep.

## 🛡️ Invariant Reachability Shield
`scripts/check_reachability.py` serves PRINCIPLE-014 R7. See [ADR-044](decisions.md).

| Audit | Catches |
|---|---|
| Call-site reachability | a function defined and tested but called from no production path |
| Key round-trip integrity | a persisted key read by production code that no production code writes |

References are counted broadly (`ast.Name` loads, attributes, `ImportFrom`), because a function stored in a tuple or passed as a callback is reachable; `PUBLIC_API_ALLOWLIST` names deliberate public API, and a test asserts no entry outlives its symbol.

## 🎮 Operational Dogfood Runner
`scripts/dogfood.py` serves PRINCIPLE-015 for AIKit's own CLIs. See [ADR-043](decisions.md).

| Track | What it proves |
|---|---|
| golden lifecycle | checkpoint, resume and complete through the real ledger CLI, asserted on disk |
| chaos perturbation | malformed flag, missing value, corrupted and 0-byte ledgers handled without a traceback |
| read-only gates | the four read-only gates pass, run concurrently in a pool of at most `os.cpu_count()` |
| help + startup budget | every CLI answers `--help` within `budget_ms` as a fresh process |
| blast radius | `repo_fingerprint()` of status-named tracked/untracked paths is unchanged after the run (ADR-154) |

- **Concurrency**: tracks not in `TIMED_TRACKS` run concurrently, each in its own sandbox folder with its own log; the startup-budget track runs alone afterwards so parallel load cannot inflate its timings (ADR-122).
- **Supervision**: `supervised()` kills the whole process tree (`taskkill /F /T` on Windows, `killpg(SIGKILL)` on POSIX).
- **Sandbox**: `--workspace <dir>` keeps every ledger write inside the run's temporary directory; the only write outside it is the git-ignored `.agents/dogfood_last_run.log`.
- **UTF-8 capture**: every spawn forces `encoding="utf-8"`; the locale codec silently dropped the CLIs' non-ASCII output.

## 🧪 Two-Tier Test Budget
Both tiers run under `python -m unittest discover tests`. See [ADR-040](decisions.md).

| Tier | Module | Budget | Contents |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | `tests/test_kit.py` | <=20ms/test, no process, no sleep | parsing, classification, ledger atomicity, AST gates, rule wording |
| Integration | `tests/test_integration.py` | <=500ms/test, timeout per spawn | multi-process races, real CLI contracts, real `git`, the dogfood run, the CLI matrix |

The unit tier is fast by construction: `TestTierBudgetDiscipline` fails on a spawn or sleep call in `test_kit.py`, and a module-level guard refuses any process the unit tier starts indirectly (ADR-049). `TestSuiteHygiene` checks every test asserts and no test module imports a network library (ADR-099).

## 💾 Ledger Concurrency & Durability
- **Locked read-modify-write**: `locked_ledger()` holds the advisory lock across load, change and save; `record_checkpoint`, `mark_task_completed` and `reset_active_task` all use it (PRINCIPLE-013 R3).
- **Lock behaviour**: acquisition times out with a `TimeoutError` carrying the triad; a lock older than 30s is broken by an atomic rename; Windows `PermissionError` during a concurrent delete is retried as contention (ADR-077).
- **Durability**: `atomic_write_json()` checks headroom, rotates `.bak`, writes a temp file, fsyncs, retries `os.replace` and fsyncs the directory (`fsync_dir`, a no-op on win32).
- **Recovery**: `load_ledger()` quarantines a corrupt file, falls back to `.bak` and migrates the schema, warning at each failed step; the CLI turns an `OSError` or `TimeoutError` into the triad and exit 1 (`report_operational_error`, ADR-098).
- **Version refusal**: `load_ledger()` validates before normalizing. A newer schema raises `UnsupportedLedgerVersion`; the file is left byte-identical, `--resume`/`--audit` report `BLOCKED` and exit 1, and a missing version is treated as legacy `1` in memory only. The adopter recipe is `.agents/rules/persistence.md.template`.
- **Resumption**: `resolve_active_phase()` reads the `active_phase` writers produce; `task_plan_checkpoint()` returns the latest `[1/` Phase 2 checkpoint (PRINCIPLE-004 R1).

## 🔀 Git Status Classification
`classify_git_status()` is pure, so every porcelain state is testable without git.

| Code | Bucket |
|---|---|
| `??` | untracked |
| `!!` | ignored (skipped) |
| `DD` `AU` `UD` `UA` `DU` `AA` `UU` | conflicted (git's closed unmerged set) |
| any other non-blank XY | modified |

`AA` and `DD` are conflicts without a `U`, so a `"U" in xy` test is insufficient; `modified` is the open default so no future code is dropped.

## 🖥️ Universal CLI Contract
Every entrypoint in `scripts/` implements one contract (PRINCIPLE-011 R5, R6), checked by `TestOperationalDogfooding` and the dogfood chaos track. See [ADR-039](decisions.md).

| Invocation | Required behaviour | Exit |
|---|---|---|
| `--help` / `-h` | usage on stdout, nothing on stderr, no writes, within the dogfood `budget_ms` | `0` |
| unknown flag or missing value | What, `Why:`, `Fix:` on stderr; the default action is never run | `2` |
| normal operation | action performed; a failure prints the triad, never a traceback | `0` / `1` |

Validators (`validate_argv`, `argv_value_errors`, `_validate_argv`) skip the value of value-taking flags, so free text such as `--desc "-n refactor"` is never read as an option, and a `--`-prefixed token is never consumed as a value.
