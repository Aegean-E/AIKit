"""
Invariant Reachability Shield (PRINCIPLE-014 Rule 7)

A passing test proves a mechanism works. It never proves the mechanism is *used*. The
highest-frequency defect class found in this repository was precisely that gap:

  - `file_lock()` was defined, exported and unit-tested with zero production call sites, so
    parallel agents silently erased each other's ledger checkpoints.
  - `format_resume_report()` read a `last_phase_num` key that no writer ever produced, so every
    resumption silently reported a default phase.

Both were green in CI. This checker closes the class mechanically by auditing two things across
production modules:

  1. Call-site reachability - every function must be called from production code or dispatched
     from an entrypoint. "A test calls it" is not reachability.
  2. Key round-trip integrity - every persisted-state key read must have a writer, and every
     key written should have a reader.

Zero external dependencies (standard library only).
