Post-Commit Verification (PRINCIPLE-018 Rule 7)

The pre-commit triad (R3) runs against the working tree, so it proves the *tree* is green, not
the *commit*. Those differ whenever staging is a subset of the tree, which is the normal case
under R2's explicit staging. Both failure modes happened on 2026-10-19: ADR-145 was committed
while its implementation sat unstaged, and a regenerated codebase map was committed twice while
stale in the commit itself.

This gate checks out the commit into a throwaway worktree in the system temp directory and runs
the whole gate set there, plus the declared proof gate when `.aikit/proof.json` exists, so a commit
that cannot stand alone is caught while it is still local, where PRINCIPLE-018 R5 undoes it with
`git reset --soft HEAD^` instead of a revert.

Zero external dependencies (standard library only).

Usage:
  python scripts/verify_commit.py [--ref <commit>] [--verbose]
Exit codes:
  0 the commit is green    1 a gate failed or the worktree could not be made    2 CLI argument misuse
