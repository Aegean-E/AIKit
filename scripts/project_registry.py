"""
Project registry: the projects AIKit builds (cockpit model, ADR-119).

AIKit is the workspace; each project it builds is its own folder and git repository, normally
`projects/<name>/`, or an existing folder attached by path. Everything AIKit records about a
project lives in that project's `.aikit/` directory, so AIKit's own gates, ledger and codebase map
never mix with project code, and a project never carries AIKit's tooling.

Projects under `projects/` are found by scanning for `.aikit/project.json`; only attached folders
outside it are listed in `projects/attached.json`. Both are ignored by AIKit's git. The stack and
test command are detected from the project's files on every call, never stored, so they cannot go
stale; `project.json` holds only an explicit `test_command` override.
