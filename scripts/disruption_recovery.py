  --resume                   Print the resumption report for an interrupted task
  --clean                    Purge orphaned temporary buffers (*.tmp_*) older than 60 s; younger
                             ones may belong to a write in progress and are kept
  --checkpoint <task_id>     Record a task checkpoint in .agents/task_ledger.json; a task's
                             first plan (--phase-num 2, --desc starting '[1/') needs --why,

  --complete <task_id>       Mark a task as completed
  --reset [reason]           Abandon and clear the active task
  --validate-commit <msg>    Validate a Conventional Commit message (PRINCIPLE-018)
  --track                    Print the lifecycle track (A/B/C) of the current changes (PRINCIPLE-002 R3)

Workspace:
  --workspace <dir>          Operate on <dir>'s ledger instead of this repository's:

                             dogfooding, which must never mutate the host repo (PRINCIPLE-015 R4).

Checkpoint options:
  --phase <name>             Lifecycle phase label (e.g. planning, implementation)

Agent options (--checkpoint, --complete, --reset; ADR-209):
