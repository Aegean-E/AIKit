"""
Project gates: the checks a project's own configuration declares, run as its Phase 4 (ADR-122).

A gate is a named shell command run in the project folder. The test gate comes from stack
detection or `test_command`; further gates are detected only from configuration the project
already has (a `[tool.ruff]` table, a `lint` script, a Go module), never guessed. The project's
`.aikit/project.json` may add or replace a gate in its `gates` map, or disable a detected one
with `null`. The hygiene scan, the guidelines check and the secret scan are built in, run on every check, and
cannot be replaced (ADR-137).
