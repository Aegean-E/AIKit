"""
Publish a project to its own GitHub repository (ADR-134).

`python aikit.py publish <name>` creates a private repository named after the project with the
GitHub CLI and pushes the project's committed history to it; a project that already has an
`origin` is pushed there instead. Nothing is uploaded unless the project has a commit, `gh` is
logged in, and a secret scan of every line the uploaded commits add is clean (PRINCIPLE-019,
ADR-145). Pushes are never forced (PRINCIPLE-018 R4), and no report shows a credential that a
remote URL carries (ADR-191).
