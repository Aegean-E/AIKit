Test Tier Budget Gate (PRINCIPLE-010 Rule 6, PRINCIPLE-014 Rule 3)

The two test tiers carry speed budgets because a slow tier stops being run. For months those
budgets were absolute wall-clock numbers that nothing measured:

  - the unit tier was budgeted under 1s and ran 1.21-1.45s for 317 tests;
  - the integration tier was budgeted under 5s and ran 7.63-7.94s for 45 tests.

Both drifted in unnoticed, because every Phase 4 command reported the tiers as green without
reporting how long they took. An absolute per-suite cap also cannot survive a growing suite:
adding a correct, fast test eventually breaks it, which pressures the agent to delete coverage.

This gate replaces the assumption with a measurement. It runs each tier once, reads the count and
duration unittest itself prints, and compares the per-test average against the tier's ceiling. A
green run over the ceiling is repeated once and the faster run is used, because host load is
additive; a red run is never retried (ADR-222). It is the single way Phase 4 runs the tiers, so it adds no second run of its own.

Zero external dependencies (standard library only).
